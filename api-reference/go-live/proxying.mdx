description: 'Use a proxy server to keep your API keys private'
---

If you are developing a mobile or desktop application that requires access to the Zamzar API, under no circumstances
should you include your Zamzar API keys in your application's binary, as this is a security risk. A malicious user
could reverse engineer your API keys from the application binary; or by monitoring the network access between your
application and our servers.

Instead, we recommend that your application route requests to our API via a proxy server that you control.
Your proxy server should authenticate your users, sign the requests to our API with one of your API keys, and forward
the request to the Zamzar API. In addition to keeping your API keys private, using a proxy server also allows you to
change your API keys without needing to distribute a new version of your application to your users.
