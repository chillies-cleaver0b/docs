## Key Points

* All requests are made over HTTPS using HTTP Basic authentication.
* Use one of your API keys as the username. No password is required.
* Your API keys are available from the [Zamzar API Dashboard](https://app.zamzar.com/dashboard/api).
* Do not store your API keys in publicly accessible source code repositories.

### Securing API Keys

We use your API keys to identify you and to bill usage of the Zamzar API to your account. As such, it's crucial to
maintain the secrecy of your API keys, as you would a password or payment details for any other account.

If you discover that you have accidentally shared one or more of your API keys, you should immediately deactivate the
affected keys via the Zamzar developer portal.

Do not store your Zamzar API keys in publicly accessible source code repositories.
